# Movie Genre Classification

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various features using the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the genre(s) of a movie based on its plot summary. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used along with n-gram feature extraction to classify movie plots into different genres.

## Features

- Utilizes Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) for text classification.
- Implements n-gram feature extraction for capturing contextual information in movie plots.
- Interactive user interface using Streamlit for inputting movie details and viewing predictions.
- Includes visualization of genre distributions and model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of movie plots along with their corresponding genres. The dataset may include information such as movie titles, plot summaries, and genre labels.
